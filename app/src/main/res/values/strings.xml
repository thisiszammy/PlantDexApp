    <string name="app_name">PlantDex</string>

    <string name="app_description1">PlantDex is the application that was developed as a proof of concept for the study of the research group of Gerarld Merales,
        Zoe Pasiliao, and Michael Zamoras. The main highlight is the Classifier section of this application, with this application, anyone can take a photo of a plant
        and it will be automatically classified by the image classifier module that is being hosted on the same server as the app. Do note that the accuracy of the classification
        would be highly dependent on the quality of the image as well as the datasets that were used to train the module.</string>

    <string name="app_description2">A few reminders when using this app. The application would require GPS Location, Camera, and Storage Permissions to run properly. These
        permissions are required for the Mapping and Classifying Module to work. Also, when classifying an image make sure the image is well-focused on the plant\'s leaf and
        for best results please take or provide a picture with decent lighting and quality.</string>
